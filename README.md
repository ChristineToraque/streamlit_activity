## Description

This Streamlit application is designed to help you explore CSV files by allowing you to upload a file and then dive into its details. It features tabs to separate different views: one for profiling individual columns (showing data types, missing values, and unique entries) and another for a general overview of the entire dataset, including summary statistics. You also have the option in the sidebar to toggle the display of the raw, unprocessed data from your uploaded file.
