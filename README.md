### I. Hello, Streamlit!

**Objective:** Understand basic components of a Streamlit app.

**Tasks:**

* Install Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
* Create a file `app.py`
* Add text with `st.title`, `st.header`, and `st.write`
* Add input fields (`st.text_input`, `st.number_input`)
* Display output based on user input

## Description

This Streamlit application, app.py, serves as a simple demonstration of Streamlit's capabilities. It showcases how to display text elements like titles and headers, and also how to incorporate interactive widgets such as a text input box and a number input field. The app then dynamically displays the values entered by the user in these input fields.
