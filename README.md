## General Setup Instructions

Before running any of the solutions, you'll need to set up your environment. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Example using `venv`):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment named ".venv"
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
   # or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
   ```
